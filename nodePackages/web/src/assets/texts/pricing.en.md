Here is a special tip for you on the most efficient way to promote this

them on your SNS using the hashtag **<span translate="no">#VRCIcons</span>**
or **<span translate="no">#LaunchpadIcons</span>** (former name).

### It used to be called “Launchpad Icons”. Why did we change the name?

The original name came from the fact that we, the author, mistakenly
thought that the generic name for the VRChat menu was “Launch Pad”.
The name was also used for the macOS application launcher and
MIDI pad controller, so I decided to change it from an SEO perspective.

### Why did we change the license from CC BY-NC 4.0?

We had some concerns, but when we considered them,
we realized that the disclaimers in the MIT license solved the problems.
So, the reason is that the license was unnecessarily overly restrictive.
