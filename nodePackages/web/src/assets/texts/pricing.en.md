### All plans appear to be free; is this true?

Yes, all plans are free. We offer the

### I want to contribute to this project. Is there a paid plan?

For now, we don't plan to offer a paid plan. That is not to say that we
don't need money, but we would welcome
[your contribution to the project](https://github.com/kurone-kito/launchpad-icons)
more than money.

skills, introducing this project to others is also a great contribution.
Here is a special tip for you on the most efficient way to promote this
project. Please enter the VRChat world, which uses the

them on your SNS using the hashtag **<span translate="no">#VRCIcons</span>**
or **<span translate="no">#LaunchpadIcons</span>** (former name).

### I'd love to support this project with some quick money

Ok, ok. I lost. Please support me on my

### It used to be called “Launchpad Icons”. Why did you change the name?

The original name came from the fact that we, the author, mistakenly
thought that the generic name for the VRChat menu was “Launch Pad”.
The name was also used for the macOS application launcher and
MIDI pad controller, so I decided to change it from an SEO perspective.
